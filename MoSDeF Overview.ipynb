    "\n",
    "The Molecular Simulation and Design Framework (MoSDeF) is a collection of open-source tools ([hosted on Github](https://github.com/mosdef-hub)) aimed at facilitating the construction and simulation of complex molecular systems - with a particular focus on the automated screening of large structural parameter spaces. All tools are written as Python packages and feature a Python-based API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MoSDeF software suite consist of three core libraries, namely [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild.git), [Foyer](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer.git), and [GMSO](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/gmso.git). Each library dedicates to handle a certain step of the chemical system initialization process, as summarized in the figure below.\n",

    "`mbuild` is a library with functinoality necessary to construct chemical systems, utilizing a hierarchical, component-based approach. The library can be used to create anything between a particle/molecule and a complex systems with multiple components. Moreover, mBuild also supports creation of systems from pre-defined files (`xyz`, `pdb`, `mol2`, `top`, `gro`, etc.,) and [SMILES string](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html), allow easy-setup for multiple types of systems.\n",

These template (or `recipe`) can be hosted independently and shared to audience of interest. A few recipes created by `mBuild` users include:\n",

    "`Foyer` is a package dedicate to perform atomtyping of chemical systems - assigning chemical potential parameters to atoms according to their contexts in the systems. This can be achieved through the process of graph matching. The atomtype's rules can be specified through [SMARTS](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html) string, which can be compared with the bond network of the system of interest. By automating the process of atomtyping (or graph matching), `Foyer` removed unncessary human interations, which may lead to unwanted, irreproducible errors. \n",
